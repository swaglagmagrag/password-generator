Random password generator! Free to use with no infringement(s) :p.

To use this password generator, you need to make sure you have the latest version of lua downloaded (link here: https://www.lua.org/download.html OR http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/)

Next, make sure you have lua properly installed (this is one of the better tutorials: https://www.bmc.com/blogs/lua-programming-language/)

Finally, type lua INSERT-FILE-PATH/password.lua and continue :)

This will most likely not be able to be used on MacOS or Linux distros, I apologize in advance.
